# Final_Project
Final Project for CS1080
This website allows the user to select a recipe from a dropdown menu. Once a recipe is created 
the user can create a shopping list. Local storage saves the ingredients from the recipe and includes 
them in the list. The user can edit the list then view the final list on its own page that they could print.

The code uses a form to create a list, local storage to save information from page to page, 
css styling and flex box, and javascript for buttons and their action.
